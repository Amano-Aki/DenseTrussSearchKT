# DenseTrussSearchKT
This is the code implemented for a paper *Cohesive Subgraph Search Using Keywords in Large Networks*. Originally written by others but modified by me.

## Compilation Note
This program needs [SNAP library](https://snap.stanford.edu/) to be installed on your computer. A `Makefile` will soon be uploaded to the repository.
